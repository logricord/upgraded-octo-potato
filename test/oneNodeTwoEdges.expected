# Test graph with one node and two edges

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node node1 to graph1

# Add two edges
added edge edge1 from node1 to node1 in graph1
added edge edge2 from node1 to node1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from node1
graph1 contains: node1
the children of node1 in graph1 are: node1(edge1) node1(edge2)
