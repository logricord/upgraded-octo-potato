# Test graph with two nodes and two edges

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node node1 to graph1
added node node2 to graph1

# Add a pair of edges
added edge edge1 from node1 to node2 in graph1
added edge edge2 from node2 to node1 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from node1 and node2
graph1 contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in graph1 are: node2(edge1)
the children of node2 in graph1 are: node1(edge2)
